Salesforce - Declarative versus Programmatic Customizations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within Salesforce there are declarative and programmatic tools. When creating
customizations, it is best practice to use a declaritive solution to a problem
first. Only if a declarative solution is not possible, then a programmatic
solution can be used. Declarative customizations are easier to create since they
can be made using point and click features within Salesforce. They also have
all security and access handled automatically. Programmatic solutions require
programming knowledge and code to be written. Since Apex code runs in system
context by default, additional work has to be done to enforce security and
access. Though declarative solutions are easier to use, they are also limited in
what can be accomplished with them. Programmatic solutions can be far more
powerful in terms of what they can do. Declarative solutions are easier to
maintain and upgrade compared to programmatic one. For example, programmatic
customizations require testing coverage that declarative customizations do not.
Certain tasks are far easier to accomplish with declarative tools such as
creating a custom object. The point and click solution walks through each step
and handles generating the metadata automatically behind the scenes. Trying to
write out all of this metadata manually would take far longer and be prone to
typing errors.
