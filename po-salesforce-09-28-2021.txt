One example of a Salesforce API is the Salesforce Metadata API. Usage of this API enables deploying and retrieving metadata to and from Salesforce orgs. Metadata 
retrieved from a Salesforce org is stored as an XML file on the local file system. With this API metadata can now be changed in two different places, within an org 
or within the XML file on a local system. Metadata retrieved from one org can also be deployed to a different org. This helps with the development process. First, 
changes can be made in development or scratch org or on a local system. Then, they can be pushed to another scratch org for testing using the deploy features on the
API. When a satisfactory version of the metadata is reached, it can deploy to an actual production org.
